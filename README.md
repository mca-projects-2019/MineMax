# MineMax
Framework for unstructured data mining, analysis and visualization.
The framework takes unstructured data from various sources  as input and provides mechanism for data storage, analysis and visualization as per user requirements.

It would be able to parse the relevant information from the unstructured data using the rules from user provided in a general purpose syntax. Eg:- Regular expression.

Once the relevant data is gathered, the tool would provide mechanisms to analyze the data using standard machine learning algorithms which the user can pick and choose using an intuitive interface.  
Some examples are 
1) Finding the correlation between the data   
2) Predicting one data from a set of other sets of data 
3) Classification of data

Next the system should provide for a good visualization of these data with plots  like histogram, scatterplot, etc (without having to send to a public cloud). 

It should generate the output in a spreadsheet format like excel.  

The framework also should provide for data base like Mongo, so that the user can specify new data to look at and analyze.

The system could be implemented using Python and its libraries.  

A well Structured GUI application helpful for easy to handle the system.
